# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Acquire is under active development and is not ready for production use. As such, we do not yet provide
backporting of security fixes and will either apply a security patch to the latest released version,
or will issue a new released version as needed.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.0.9   | :x:                |
| 0.0.8   | :x:                |
| < 0.0.8 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We do really appreciate any reporting of security problems. As Acquire is not yet a production service 
please feel free to report security issues in an open manner and we will respond as a matter
of priority. We particularly welcome people providing proof-of-concept attacks, opening issues
to discuss design choices or possible attack vectors, and pull requests for bug and security
fixes.

If you wish to submit a security issue publicly, please do so via the "issues" in this repo, and
expect a response as quickly as we can (likely within a day or two). If you want to submit a 
private security issue, then please email [chryswoods@gmail.com](chryswoods@gmail.com).
Again, expect a response within a few days, from which we will open a discussion.
